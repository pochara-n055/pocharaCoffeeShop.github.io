        <h1 id="MenuCategories">Good Coffee When You Need It!</h1>
            
        <p>That's our slogan. Because sometimes we all need a good coffee... And that's what Francine Moka wants to provide to people. Especially when they need it. </p>
        
        <h1 id="MenuCategories">History</h1>
            
        <p>This business, founded in 2018 by Francine and a few friends, was originally named "Doylestown Coffee". But due to faulty electrical wiring, a devastating fire had broken out a few months later and it destroyed the shop entirely. Luckily, nobody was injured and everyone got out safely. While rebuilding, Francine decided to rename the shop to FraMoka Latte in order to be more unique, as the previous name had been generic. She reopened the shop in 2019 after an arduous and lengthy redesign.</p>
            
        <h1 id="MenuCategories">About the Owner</h1>
